## Overview
- this is a one-page project where user can enter his/her information(name, last name, image) and the program validates it and outputs back to the screen. the ideas that were taken in mind during building process are: 
    1. avoiding code duplication - I tried to create separate files for reusable codes.
    2. security issues - I have used post method for deleting items to minimize the risk of sql injection.
    3. PDO - I have used PDO to communicate with the database.
